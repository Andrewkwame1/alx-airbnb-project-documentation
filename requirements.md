# Airbnb Clone – Backend Requirements Documentation

This document specifies the **technical and functional requirements** for three key backend features:  
1. **User Authentication**  
2. **Property Management**  
3. **Booking System**  

Each feature includes API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.

## 1. User Authentication

### Functional Requirements
- Allow users to **register** with unique email and password.
- Provide secure **login** with token-based authentication.
- Enable users to **update their profile** (name, phone number, role).
- Enforce **password encryption** using industry-standard hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Ensure only authenticated users can access restricted features.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/v1/auth/register**  
  - Registers a new user.
- **POST /api/v1/auth/login**  
  - Authenticates user and returns JWT token.
- **GET /api/v1/users/:id**  
  - Retrieves user profile (requires authentication).
- **PUT /api/v1/users/:id**  
  - Updates user profile.

### Input / Output
- **Register Input**: `{ first_name, last_name, email, password, phone_number, role }`  
- **Register Output**: `{ user_id, email, role, created_at }`  
- **Login Input**: `{ email, password }`  
- **Login Output**: `{ token, user: { id, email, role } }`

### Validation Rules
- Email must be unique and valid format.
- Password must be at least 8 characters, include letters & numbers.
- Role must be one of: `guest`, `host`, `admin`.

### Performance Criteria
- Authentication requests must respond in under **300ms**.  
- Tokens should expire within **24 hours**.  
- Handle **at least 100 concurrent login requests** without failure.

## 2. Property Management

### Functional Requirements
- Hosts can **create, update, and delete properties**.  
- Guests can **search and view property listings**.  
- Properties must include details like title, description, price, location, and availability.  

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/v1/properties**  
  - Add a new property (host only).  
- **GET /api/v1/properties**  
  - Retrieve all properties (supports filters: location, price range, date).  
- **GET /api/v1/properties/:id**  
  - Retrieve a single property by ID.  
- **PUT /api/v1/properties/:id**  
  - Update property details (host only).  
- **DELETE /api/v1/properties/:id**  
  - Delete a property (host only).  

### Input / Output
- **Property Input**: `{ title, description, price_per_night, location, availability, host_id }`  
- **Property Output**: `{ property_id, title, price_per_night, location, created_at }`

### Validation Rules
- Price must be a positive number.  
- Title must not exceed 100 characters.  
- Availability dates must not overlap with existing bookings.  
- Only the property’s host can modify or delete it.  

### Performance Criteria
- Property search results should return within **500ms**.  
- Support filtering and pagination for large datasets.  
- Handle **10,000+ active listings** efficiently.

## 3. Booking System

### Functional Requirements
- Guests can **book properties** for a specific date range.  
- System must check for **date conflicts** before confirming booking.  
- Payments must be processed securely (via payment gateway).  
- Send **notifications** (email or system alerts) to both guest and host upon booking confirmation.  

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/v1/bookings**  
  - Create a booking (guest only).  
- **GET /api/v1/bookings/:id**  
  - Retrieve booking details.  
- **GET /api/v1/users/:id/bookings**  
  - Retrieve all bookings for a specific user.  
- **DELETE /api/v1/bookings/:id**  
  - Cancel a booking (guest or admin).  

### Input / Output
- **Booking Input**: `{ property_id, guest_id, start_date, end_date, payment_info }`  
- **Booking Output**: `{ booking_id, property_id, guest_id, total_cost, status, created_at }`

### Validation Rules
- Start date must be before end date.  
- Property must exist and be available for selected dates.  
- Payment info must be valid before booking is confirmed.  

### Performance Criteria
- Conflict checking must run in **under 200ms**.  
- Handle **1000+ concurrent booking requests** without double-booking.  
- Ensure **100% transactional integrity** (rollback on payment failure).
